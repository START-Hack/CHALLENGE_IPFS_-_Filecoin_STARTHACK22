# Why IPFS and Filecoin

The open-source protocol IPFS and storage network Filecoin are deeply committed to nurturing hacker communities. Through our events and challenges, we encourage and empower developers and entrepreneurs to solve significant problems, ship innovative applications and shape the future of the web to be more decentralized, robust, and secure. 

We reward our participants' interest and contributions with attractive prizes. Beyond hackathons, together with our ecosystem partners and collaborators, we offer a broad range of follow-on opportunities (incl. access to grants, accelerators, seed funding and more) so ideas can grow into winning ventures.

# About

The **Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS)** is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS upgrades the web to work in a decentralized manner, addressing data by what it is instead of where it’s located on the network or who is hosting it.

**Filecoin** is the world’s largest decentralized storage network that allows users to store, request, and transfer data via a verifiable marketplace. Filecoin is an entirely open-source alternative to costly cloud storage, where a blockchain network offers efficiently priced and geographically decentralized storage that ensures the persistence of user’s data.

# Challenge statement 


|  Challenge statement |  PRIZE |
|---|---|
|  **Best use of IPFS and/or Filecoin** |  Grand Prize 1000 CHF <br /> 2x Runner-up Prizes 500 CHF |

You can develop your project for any of the cases and use IPFS/Filecoin technology stack to qualify for our prize. 



# Tools and resources

We prepared this [getting started page](https://bitly.protocol.ai/IPFS_Filecoin_Get_Started) to help you build with our tech stack, including developer tools that help you store data on both IPFS and Filecoin quickly and easily.

Usage of our partner tools is welcomed and allowed to qualify for our challenge. Tools that you could find usefull for a quick start:

- [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/) - simple API to store your NFT content on IPFS and pin on Filecoin automatically (1TB free storage for anyone + extension possible)
- [Web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) - simple API to store any content on IPFS and pin on Filecoin automatically (1TB free storage for anyone + extension possible)
- [Fleek.co](https://fleek.co/) - tool that makes it easy to build websites and apps on the new open web: permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant, and free of centralized gatekeepers
- [Powergate by Textile](docs.textile.io/powergate) - for powerful ways to connect & extend libp2p, IPFS & Filecoin

# Judging criteria 

## Qualifying criteria for prize:

- Filecoin / IPFS used via any of the tools or services mentioned above and are a necessary component for the project.
- Using an IPFS HTTP gateway doesn’t count as building on top of IPFS. Exclusively basing your submission on that does not make you eligible for prizes.

## Judging criteria:

1. **Potential Impact**: Does it fill a gap in the universe, and have the potential to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience or market?
2. **Technical Accomplishment**: Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete? Does the project interact with IPFS/Filecoin under-the-hood (i.e., more than simply retrieve a CID from a gateway)?
3. **Novelty/Originality**: Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way?
4. **Design and Usability**: Is it easy to use? Does the visual design delight you? If targeting developers, is the experience smooth and intuitive?
5. **Creativity/Fun/Wow-Factor**: Is it creative and put a smile on people’s faces?
