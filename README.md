# CHALLENGE_PROTOCOL_LABS_STARTHACK22


# Why Protocol Labs

The open-source protocol IPFS and storage network Filecoin are deeply committed to nurturing hacker communities. Through our events and challenges, we encourage and empower developers and entrepreneurs to solve significant problems, ship innovative applications and shape the future of the web to be more decentralized, robust, and secure. 

We reward our participants' interest and contributions with attractive prizes. Beyond hackathons, together with our ecosystem partners and collaborators, we offer a broad range of follow-on opportunities (incl. access to grants, accelerators, seed funding and more) so ideas can grow into winning ventures.

# About

The **Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS)** is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS upgrades the web to work in a decentralized manner, addressing data by what it is instead of where it’s located on the network or who is hosting it.

**Filecoin** is the world’s largest decentralized storage network that allows users to store, request, and transfer data via a verifiable marketplace. Filecoin is an entirely open-source alternative to costly cloud storage, where a blockchain network offers efficiently priced and geographically decentralized storage that ensures the persistence of user’s data.
